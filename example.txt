Hello there!

This is a sample text file that we'll use to demonstrate the `cat` command in Unix-like operating systems.

The `cat` command is commonly used to display the contents of a file on the terminal.

Let's see how it works:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where this file is located.
3. Type `cat filename.txt` and press Enter.

You should see the entire contents of this file printed on the terminal.

That's it for the demonstration!

Feel free to modify this file and experiment with the `cat` command further.
